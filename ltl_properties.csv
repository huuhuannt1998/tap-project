"Sure, let's start by generating the Trigger-Action rules and then convert them to Linear Temporal Logic (LTL).

### Trigger-Action Rule
1. **Trigger**: Motion sensor detects motion.
2. **Action**: Turn on the Aeotec switch (Aeotec Outlet 1).

### Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) Representation
The LTL formula that represents this behavior is:

\[ G (\text{motion\_sensor\_motion\_detected} \rightarrow F \text{switch\_on\_Aeotec\_Outlet\_1}) \]

Where:
- \( G \) stands for ""Globally,"" indicating that the rule applies at all times.
- \( \rightarrow \) stands for ""implies.""
- \( F \) stands for ""Finally,"" indicating that at some point in the future, the action will occur if the trigger is true.

In plain English, this LTL formula means that globally, whenever the motion sensor detects motion, it will eventually cause the Aeotec switch to turn on.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula
- **Globally (G)**: The rule should always be active.
- **Trigger (motion_sensor_motion_detected)**: The motion sensor detects motion.
- **Implies (â†’)**: If the trigger condition is true, then...
- **Finally (F)**: ...eventually...
- **Action (switch_on_Aeotec_Outlet_1)**: ...the Aeotec switch will turn on.

This ensures that every time the motion sensor detects motion, the Aeotec switch is guaranteed to turn on at some point in the future.","### Properties from User Input

1. **Motion Sensor**: The device that detects motion.
    - Device ID: `badd4ded-6183-4fb6-928c-179dcd6d1229`
    - Label: ""Motion Sensor""
    - Capability: ""motionSensor""

2. **Centralite Switch**: The switch that needs to be turned on.
    - Device ID: `03f87109-2da4-4376-8372-580372d9ded6`
    - Label: ""Centralite Outlet 1""
    - Capability: ""switch""
    
### Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)

The LTL formula to express that whenever the motion sensor detects motion, the Centralite switch should eventually be turned on can be written as:

\[ \mathbf{G} (\text{motion\_sensor\_active} \rightarrow \mathbf{F} \text{switch\_on\_Centralite\_Outlet\_1}) \]

### Explanation

- **G** (Globally): Specifies that the condition should hold at all times.
- **motion\_sensor\_active**: Represents the event when the motion sensor detects motion.
- **F** (Finally): Specifies that the condition should eventually hold.
- **switch\_on\_Centralite\_Outlet\_1**: Represents the event where the Centralite switch is turned on.

### Final LTL Formula

\[ \mathbf{G} (\text{motion\_sensor\_active} \rightarrow \mathbf{F} \text{switch\_on\_Centralite\_Outlet\_1}) \]"
