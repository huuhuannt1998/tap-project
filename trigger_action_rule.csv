Trigger Action Rule
"Certainly! Based on the devices in your SmartThings account, I'll create a Trigger-Action rule. Let's assume you want to create a rule where if motion is detected by the ""Motion Sensor"" (deviceId: `badd4ded-6183-4fb6-928c-179dcd6d1229`), then the ""Aeotec Outlet 1"" (deviceId: `7b66afce-2f5a-4bc4-b55f-6b949389f86d`) should turn on.

Here is the Trigger-Action rule:

```json
{
    ""name"": ""Motion Detected - Turn On Outlet"",
    ""trigger"": {
        ""deviceId"": ""badd4ded-6183-4fb6-928c-179dcd6d1229"",
        ""componentId"": ""main"",
        ""capability"": ""motionSensor"",
        ""attribute"": ""motion"",
        ""value"": ""active""
    },
    ""action"": {
        ""deviceId"": ""7b66afce-2f5a-4bc4-b55f-6b949389f86d"",
        ""componentId"": ""main"",
        ""capability"": ""switch"",
        ""command"": ""on""
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Trigger**:
  - **deviceId**: `badd4ded-6183-4fb6-928c-179dcd6d1229` (Motion Sensor)
  - **componentId**: `main` (main component of the device)
  - **capability**: `motionSensor` (capability to detect motion)
  - **attribute**: `motion` (attribute within the capability to monitor)
  - **value**: `active` (the attribute value that triggers the action)

- **Action**:
  - **deviceId**: `7b66afce-2f5a-4bc4-b55f-6b949389f86d` (Aeotec Outlet 1)
  - **componentId**: `main` (main component of the device)
  - **capability**: `switch` (capability to control the switch)
  - **command**: `on` (command to turn the switch on)

This rule will ensure that whenever motion is detected by the Motion Sensor, the Aeotec Outlet 1 will be turned on."
