Trigger Action Rule
"Certainly! Based on the devices in your SmartThings account, let's create a Trigger-Action rule. This rule will turn on the ""Aeotec Outlet 1"" whenever motion is detected by the ""Motion Sensor"". Here are the details:

**Trigger-Action Rule:**
- **Trigger:** Motion detected by ""Motion Sensor""
- **Action:** Turn on ""Aeotec Outlet 1""

Here is how you can configure this rule:

1. **Open the SmartThings App:**
   - Launch the SmartThings app on your smartphone or access the SmartThings web interface.

2. **Navigate to Automations:**
   - Go to the ""Automations"" tab where you can create and manage your automation rules.

3. **Create a New Automation:**
   - Tap on the ""+"" or ""Add Automation"" button to create a new rule.

4. **Configure the Trigger:**
   - **Select Trigger Device:** Choose the ""Motion Sensor"" (label: Motion Sensor).
   - **Select Trigger Condition:** Select ""Motion Detected"" as the trigger condition.

5. **Configure the Action:**
   - **Select Action Device:** Choose the ""Aeotec Outlet 1"" (label: Aeotec Outlet 1).
   - **Select Action:** Set the action to ""Turn On"".

6. **Save the Automation:**
   - Give your automation rule a name, such as ""Turn On Outlet on Motion"".
   - Save the automation rule.

Here's a more detailed example of how the rule might look:

### Trigger
- **Device:** Motion Sensor
- **Condition:** Motion Detected

### Action
- **Device:** Aeotec Outlet 1
- **Action:** Turn On

### Rule Name
- **Name:** Turn On Outlet on Motion

Once this automation is set up, every time the motion sensor detects motion, it will automatically turn on the Aeotec outlet, potentially powering any device connected to it.
